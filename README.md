# Brain Tumor Classification using VGG16 and ResNet18 ðŸ§ 

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the classification of brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning. We developed and evaluated two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, **VGG16** and **ResNet18**, to classify brain MRI images into four distinct categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The project leverages transfer learning and advanced image preprocessing techniques to achieve high classification accuracy, with ResNet18 demonstrating superior performance.

## Motivation
Brain tumors are among the most complex and fatal diseases, making early and accurate detection critical for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis relies on manual MRI scan analysis, which is time-consuming and prone to human error due to subjectivity and fatigue. Deep learning, particularly CNNs, offers a powerful solution to automate and enhance medical image analysis, demonstrating remarkable accuracy in visual pattern recognition.

Our motivation is to assist medical professionals in making faster, more accurate diagnoses by developing a reliable, automated system using VGG16 and ResNet18.

    * Glioma
    * Meningioma
    * Pituitary Tumor
    * No Tumor
* **Format:** Folder-structured images, split into training and testing sets.
* **Preprocessing:**
    * Images resized to $224 \times 224$ pixels for compatibility with CNN input layers.

## Model Architectures
Both VGG16 and ResNet18 models were utilized, pre-trained on ImageNet, with their final classification layers replaced and fine-tuned for our specific 4-class dataset.

* **VGG16:**
    * A deep 16-layer CNN.
    * Composed of sequential stacked convolutional blocks.
    * Features are flattened and connected to a dense layer of size $512 \rightarrow 4$ for classification.

    * An 18-layer residual CNN.
    * Includes **skip connections** to combat vanishing gradient issues, enabling the training of deeper networks.
    * The final layer was modified to output 4-class predictions.
